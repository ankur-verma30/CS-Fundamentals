🧱 Monolith vs 🧩 Microservices

🔍 What is a Monolith?
➤ A monolith is a single deployable unit that contain the entire application(business logic, database interactions, UI etc.).
➤Common misconception: Monolith not equals to single machine.
1. A monolith can scale horizontally over multiple servers.
2. Still, it is a single codebase, tightly coupled and deployed together.

🧩 What is a Microservice?
➤ A microservice encapsulates a single business capability, along with its own data and logic.
➤ Each service is independently deployable, loosely coupled, and may have its own database.
➤ Clients ofter interact with an API Gateway, not directly with each microservice.

✅ Advantages of Monoliths
| Benefit                       | Explanation                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 👥 Ideal for Small Teams  | Easier to manage with limited developers. Lower overhead in coordination.           |
| ⚙️ Fewer Moving Parts     | No need to manage separate services, APIs, networking layers.                       |
| 🚀 Simpler Deployment     | One package to test, deploy, and monitor. No version mismatch between services.     |
| 🧪 Centralized Setup Code | Shared utilities, setup/configuration code don't need duplication.                  |
| ⚡ Performance             | In-process function calls are faster than inter-service communication over network. |

❌ Disadvantages of Monoliths
| Drawback                         | Explanation                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📚 Onboarding is Hard        | New developers need to understand the full system. High cognitive load.      |
| 🧩 Tight Coupling            | Changes in one part can unintentionally affect other areas. Hard to isolate. |
| 🚧 Harder Testing            | Everything touches everything; unit tests require full context.              |
| 🔄 Frequent Full Deployments | Any change redeploys the whole system, increasing deployment risk.           |
| 🛑 Single Point of Failure   | If one part crashes (e.g., profile service), entire app might go down.       |

✅ Advantages of Microservices
| Benefit                             | Explanation                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📏 Scalable Architecture        | Each microservice can scale independently based on its own load.                    |
| 🔁 Parallel Development         | Different teams can work on different services without stepping on each other.      |
| 🧠 Easier Onboarding            | New engineers need to learn only their microservice domain.                         |
| 📊 Resource Optimization        | Easily identify and scale only the parts of system under load (e.g., chat service). |
| 🧼 Clear Separation of Concerns | Encourages modular, maintainable design.                                            |

❌ Disadvantages of Microservices
| Drawback                     | Explanation                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 Complex Design        | Good microservices require smart architectural planning.                                  |
| 🔗 Over-Engineering Risk | If two services talk only to each other, they probably shouldn't be separate.             |
| 🔄 RPC Overhead          | Communication between services is over the network, adding latency and points of failure. |
| 🔍 Distributed Debugging | Tracing bugs across services becomes harder (needs observability tools).                  |
| 🛠️ DevOps Complexity    | Needs containerization, service discovery, load balancing, CI/CD pipelines, etc.          |

🧠 Design Takeaways
Start with Monolith if:
1. Small Teams
2. MVP/Prototype
3. Rapid iteration needed
4. Tight integration between features.

Choose Microservices if:
1. System is large-scale or enterprise level.
2. Many teams contributing
3. Performance bottlenecks isolated to domains
4. High availability and independent deployment are important

💡 In a system design, you're often expected to go with microservices for large systems, but justify it:

➤ Independent scalability
➤ Parallel team development
➤ Better fault isolation
