Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
Goal: Make systems cheaper and faster by serving static content closer to users.

üîç Prerequisites
Caching: Understanding basic caching mechanism.
Distributed Systems: General idea of geographically spread systems.

üåê Step-by-Step Walkthrough of the Concept
1. Initial Setup Example
‚û§ User visits a website like website.io
‚û§ DNS resolves the domain to an IP.
‚û§ The browser connects to the server to fetch the HTML page.

2. Why Caching is Needed
HTML pages can be cached in local storage or memory for faster access.
A server returns these cached responses directly.

3. Problems with Centralized Caching
‚û§ Latency: One server location(e.g. India) may be fast for Indian users, but slow for US or Japan users.
‚û§ Regulations: Some data is legally allowed to be served only in specific regions(e.g. region-specific movies).

4. Solution: Geo-Distributed Caching(CDN)
‚û§ Caches are distributed globally.
‚û§ Each region has a local cache node(or edge server).
‚û§ These nodes store frequently accessed, locally relevant content.

‚úÖ Benefits of CDNs
‚û§ Low latency for users around the world.
‚û§ Compliance with local data laws.
‚û§ Relevant content delivery(India gets Indian content; US gets US content).
‚û§ Faster load times -> Better user experience and trust.
‚û§ Cost-efficient for bussiness.

üß† Important Concepts
‚û§ A CDN cache is a type of server with a file system and IP.
‚û§ It can be controlled and updated by a central server.
‚û§ Content in CDNs is usually static: HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos.

üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Example
‚û§ Amazon CloudFront(CDN service by AWS)
‚û§ Integrates with S3.
‚û§ Automatically updates when a new file is uploaded.

‚ö° TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed system of cache servers that stores static content close to users to ensure fast, cheap, and region-compliant data delivery.
