✅ Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

➤ Services don't call each other directly.
➤ Instead, they communicate via events through an event bus.
➤ A service produces an event indicating something has changed.
➤ Other services (subscribers) consume relevant events and may trigger further events.
➤ Similar to Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub), but with state changes and decoupled workflows.

🧠 Core Components
➤ Event Bus: Central system to which services publish or subscribe.
➤ Producers: Services emitting events.
➤ Consumers: Services acting upon received events.
➤ Event Store: (Optional) Persists all emitted events for auditing or replay.

🎮 Example Use Case (Gaming)
➤ In games like Counter-Strike, player actions are sent as timestamped events.
➤ Server replays event history to determine if a shot was valid based on past player positions.

📌 Key Features
1. Local Event Storage:
➤ Each service can store events relevant to it.
➤ Increases availability.

2. Persistence:
➤ Services can maintain state by replaying events.
➤ Enables time-travel debugging or restoring to previous states.

3. Replay and Replacement:
➤ New services can replay historical events to sync with existing ones.
➤ Easy version upgrades or replacements.

✅ Advantages
➤ High availability: Doesn’t rely on every service being live.
➤ Resilience: New services can catch up using event history.
➤ Debugging: Can replay events to debug or fix issues.
➤ Decoupling: Services are loosely coupled.
➤ Transactional guarantees:
1. At most once: e.g., welcome email.
2. At least once: e.g., invoice email.


❌ Disadvantages
Inconsistent State:
➤ Different services may have outdated or mismatched data.

Difficult Debugging:
➤ Hard to trace event flow (no direct calls).

External Dependency Limitation:
➤ Can't replay events if the outcome depends on real-time external systems (e.g., sending emails).

Low Fine-Grained Control:
➤ Can't directly control target, timeout, or ordering like HTTP.

Security Concerns:
➤ Over-publishing might leak sensitive state changes.

Complicated Event Management:
➤ Determining who consumes what and enforcing that is tough.

Event Replay Complexity:
➤ Replay all → impractical for huge logs.

Diff-based or Undo models needed.
➤ Event compaction helps manage size.

🧠 Developer Concerns
➤ Difficult to reason: Hard to understand full system flow just by reading code.
➤ Hard to revert to request-response: Not easily adaptable if you want synchronous interaction later.

📌 When to Use EDA
Useful when:
➤ High availability is more important than consistency.
➤ Services need to evolve independently.
➤ Replay, auditing, or logging is important.

Not ideal if:
➤ You need strict request/response flow.
➤ You rely heavily on real-time external API calls.

🔁 Examples
➤ Git (Commit History) → Event logs
➤ React → State changes handled via events
➤ Node.js → Event-driven I/O
➤ Gaming servers → Process actions via timestamped events
