📚 Types of Databases

🔹 1. Relational Database (RDBMS)
Stores data in structured tables(rows & columns) where tables are interrelated using key (primary, foreign).

🎯 Key Features:
➤ Uses SQL for querying (Structured Query Language)
➤ Data is normalized to reduce redundancy.
➤ Relationships established through keys
➤ ACID-compliant: ensures atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability.

📌 Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB, MS SQL Server

🔹 2. NoSQL Database
Stands for "Not Only SQL". Used for semi-structured or unstructured data. No fixed schema.Key-Value store = like HashMap

🎯 Key Features:
➤ Flexible schema
➤ Data often stored as key-value pairs, documents, wide-columns, or graphs
➤ Great for scalability, real-time big data applications.

📌 Examples:
MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase

🔹 3. Object-Oriented Database (OODB)
Stores data as objects (like in OOP), using classes, objects, inheritance.

🎯 Key Features:
➤ Matches OOP paradigm (used in Java, C++)
➤ Stores methods and attributes together
➤ Can handle complex data types directly

📌 Examples: db4o, ObjectDB

🔹 4. In-Memory Database
Stores data in RAM(Primary Memory) instead of disk, enabling faster data access.

🎯 Key Features:
➤ Very fast: used in real-time systems.
➤ No disk I/O latency
➤ Volatile (data lost if power goes off, unless backed up).

📌 Examples: Redis, Memcached, SAP HANA

🔹 5. Time-Series Database
Stores data indexed by time (timestamped entries)

🎯 Key Features:
➤ Great for logging events, sensor data
➤ Optimized for append-only, time-based queries

📌 Examples:
InfluxDB, TimescaleDB

🔹 6. Spatial Database
Designed to store and query geospatial data (2D/3D geometry)

🎯 Key Features:
➤ Stores maps, shapes, geographic locations
➤ Supports spatial queries (e.g., “find all restaurants within 5km”)

📌 Examples:
PostGIS, Oracle Spatial

🔹 7. Multimedia Database
Stores and retrieves media content like images, audio, video, text.

🎯 Key Features:
➤Stores metadata for each file
➤Advanced compression and streaming handling

📌 Examples:
VIRAGE, Oracle Multimedia

🔹 8. Columnar Database
Stores data column-wise instead of row-wise

🎯 Key Features:
➤ Better for analytics and aggregation queries
➤ Efficient compression

📌 Examples:
Apache HBase, Amazon Redshift

🔹 9. XML Database
Stores data in XML format for easy parsing and platform-independent sharing.

🎯 Key Features:
➤ Semi-structured storage
➤ Supports XPath, XQuery for querying

📌 Examples:
BaseX, eXist-db

🔹 10. NewSQL Database
➤ Bridges the gap between SQL & NoSQL
➤ Keeps SQL-like features
➤ Adds scalability from NoSQL

🎯 Key Features:
➤ ACID compliance
➤ Horizontal scalability
➤ Distributed architecture

📌 Examples:
Google Spanner, CockroachDB

🔹 11. Blockchain Database
Stores data in immutable blocks, linked using cryptography

🎯 Key Features:
➤ Decentralized
➤ Tamper-proof
➤ Used in cryptocurrencies and secure apps

📌 Examples:
BigchainDB
