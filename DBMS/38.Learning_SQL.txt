🧠 Why SQL?
We need a language to interact with databases—whether it's to store, retrieve, update, or delete data.
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used for interacting with Relational Databases.

With SQL, we can perform:

➤ Create – Create new records or database structures
➤ Read – Retrieve data from tables
➤ Update – Modify existing records
➤ Delete – Remove data

These operations are known as CRUD operations and are essential for any database-driven application.

🧠 What is MySQL?
MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses SQL as its querying language.
It is:
➤ Open-source and widely used in web and enterprise applications
➤ Known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use
➤ Maintained by Oracle Corporation

MySQL allows you to:
➤ Store data in tables
➤ Establish relationships using primary and foreign keys
➤ Enforce data integrity and security
➤ Handle large volumes of structured data efficiently

✅ In short:
SQL is the language, while MySQL is a software (RDBMS) that understands and executes SQL queries.

🧠 How SQL Helps Us
SQL (Structured Query Language) enables users to interact with relational databases effectively. It supports a wide range of operations, grouped into the following categories:

✅ 1. Retrieving Data
➤ SQL allows users to fetch specific and meaningful data from large datasets.
➤ Users can apply filters, conditions, sorting, and grouping to extract exactly what is needed.
➤ This is essential for generating reports, dashboards, and data analysis.

✅ 2. Manipulating Data
➤ SQL provides commands to add, update, and delete records in the database.
➤ These operations help maintain up-to-date and accurate information.
➤ It supports bulk updates and conditional changes as well.

✅ 3. Defining Data
➤ SQL allows the creation and modification of the database structure.
➤ This includes creating or altering tables, views, indexes, and constraints.
➤ It ensures the data is stored in an organized and consistent format.

✅ 4. Controlling Data
➤ SQL supports user access control by allowing database administrators to grant or revoke permissions.
➤ It ensures that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users.
➤ Helps enforce security, privacy, and role-based access.

🧠 Types of SQL Commands
SQL commands are categorized based on the type of operation they perform on the database:

✅ 1. Data Query Language (DQL)
➤ Purpose: To retrieve data from the database.

Command: SELECT
Note: Although it has only one command, it's one of the most frequently used.

✅ 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
➤ Purpose: To manipulate data stored in existing tables.
Common Operations:
1. Insert new records
2. Update existing records
3. Delete records

Commands: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
Affects: Only the data, not the structure.

✅ 3. Data Definition Language (DDL)
➤ Purpose: To define or modify the structure of database objects.

Used for:
Creating tables, indexes, and views
Modifying table structure
Deleting database objects

Commands: CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME
Note: DDL commands are usually auto-committed (changes are permanent).

✅ 4. Data Control Language (DCL)
➤ Purpose: To control access to data and database operations.

Used for:
Granting permissions to users
Revoking access when needed

Commands: GRANT, REVOKE
Helps enforce: Data security and role-based access control.

✅ 5. Transaction Control Language (TCL)
➤ Purpose: To manage transactions in a database.

Used to:
Commit changes
Roll back changes in case of errors
Ensure consistency of operations

Commands: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

🧠 Understanding Rows and Columns in a Table
Columns = Attributes / Fields / Characteristics
Each column in a table represents a specific attribute of the entity.
Example: In a Student table, columns could be RollNo, Name, Age, Department.

Rows = Records / Tuples
Each row stores a complete set of data for one instance of the entity.
In other words, a row contains all the attribute values for a single entity.

🧠 Hierarchy in a Relational Database System

✅ 1. Server
➤ A database server hosts and manages one or more databases.
➤ It handles connections, storage, and access control.

✅ 2. Database
➤ A database is a logical collection of related data.
➤ You can create multiple databases on a single server.
➤ Each database is independent and contains its own tables, users, permissions, etc.

✅ 3. Tables
➤ A database is made up of multiple tables.
➤ Each table stores data related to a specific entity (e.g., students, employees).
➤ Tables are structured in rows and columns.

✅ 4. Records (Rows)
➤ A record (also called a tuple) represents one entry in the table.
➤ Each row holds data for one instance of the entity.

✅ 5. Attributes (Columns)
➤ Each record is made up of attributes (columns).
➤ Attributes represent the properties or characteristics of the entity.
Example: For a Student record, attributes could be Name, Roll No, Marks, etc.

🔁Server → Databases → Tables → Records → Attributes

🧠 Creation of Database
➤ We use the CREATE DATABASE statement to create a new database.
➤ SQL commands are not case-sensitive, but it's good practice to use uppercase for keywords.

✅ Basic Command: 
CREATE DATABASE database_name;

✅ To Avoid Errors (If Database Already Exists):
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS database_name;
The IF NOT EXISTS clause is used to prevent errors if the database already exists.

This clause is commonly used with CREATE TABLE as well.

🧠 Deletion of Database
➤ We use the DROP DATABASE statement to permanently delete a database.
➤ This removes the entire database, including all:
1. Tables
2. Data
3. Views
4. Stored procedures
5. Other objects

It is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command.

✅ Basic Command:
DROP DATABASE database_name;

✅ To Avoid Errors (If Database Doesn’t Exist):
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS database_name;

The IF EXISTS clause helps avoid runtime errors by checking if the database exists before trying to delete it.

🧠 Using a Database
➤ To work with a specific database, we use the USE statement.
➤ This command sets the active database for your current session.
➤ After executing it, all subsequent operations (like creating tables or inserting data) will apply to the selected database.

✅ Command:
USE database_name;

📝 Note:
➤ You must use this command before performing any operations on tables if multiple databases exist on the server.
➤ This helps the DBMS understand which database you’re referring to.

🧠 Showing All Databases
➤ To view all databases available on the current database server, we use the SHOW DATABASES command.
➤ It displays a list of all existing databases, whether created by the user or system-defined.

✅ Command:
SHOW DATABASES;

📝 Note:
➤ You can only see databases for which you have access privileges.
➤ This is helpful when working on a shared server or verifying successful creation of a new database.

🧠 Working with Tables

🧠 Creating a Table
➤ We use the CREATE TABLE statement to define a new table within a database.
➤ It is a DDL command.
➤ A table consists of columns, each with a data type and optional constraints to enforce rules on the data.

✅ Syntax:
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 data_type1 constraint1,
    column2 data_type2 constraint2,
    column3 data_type3 constraint3,
    ...
);

✅Example:
CREATE TABLE course(
cid INT,
cname VARCHAR(50)
);

📝 Explanation:
➤ table_name: Name of the table you want to create.
➤ column1, column2, ...: Names of the columns (attributes).
➤ data_type: Defines the type of data (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE).
➤ constraint (optional): Rules like PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, etc.

🧠 Inserting Values into a Table
➤ INSERT is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) command.
➤ It is used to add new records (rows) into an existing table.

✅ Syntax:
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ..., columnN)
VALUES (value1, value2, ..., valueN);
📝 Key Points:
➤ Column names should match the order of values provided.
➤ You must ensure the values follow the data type and constraint rules defined during table creation.

➤ If you want to insert into all columns, you can skip the column list:
INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, ..., valueN);

✅Example:
INSERT INTO course VALUES
(1,"Ankur Verma"),
(2,"Isha Kumari"),
(3,"Deepak Yadav");

🧠 Viewing Data from a Table
➤ We use the SELECT command to retrieve data from one or more columns in a table.
➤ It is a DQL (Data Query Language) command.

✅ Use Cases:
🔹 To view specific columns:
SELECT column_name1, column_name2 FROM table_name;
Example:
SELECT cid FROM course;
(This displays only the cid column from the course table.)

🔹 To view all columns and all records:
SELECT * FROM table_name;
Example:
SELECT * FROM course;
(This displays the entire table, including all columns and all rows.)

📝 Note:
➤ * is a wildcard that means "all columns".
➤ The result set may be filtered or sorted further using clauses like WHERE, ORDER BY, etc.

🧠 Viewing All Tables in a Database
➤ We use the SHOW TABLES command to list all tables present in the currently selected database.
➤ It helps verify if a table was created successfully or to explore existing tables.

✅ Command:
SHOW TABLES;

📝 Note:
➤ You must first select a database using the USE database_name; command before running SHOW TABLES.
➤ Only tables within the currently active database will be shown.
➤ Useful for database exploration and management.

🧠 Data Types in SQL
SQL provides various data types to define the type of data that can be stored in each column of a table.

✅ 1. Numeric Data Types
Used to store numbers (integers or decimals).

➤ INT / INTEGER – Whole numbers (INT_MIN to INT_MAX)
➤ SMALLINT – Smaller range of integers
➤ BIGINT – Larger range of integers
➤ DECIMAL(p,s) – Fixed-point number with precision p and scale s(8-byte) (e.g., DECIMAL(5,2) → 123.45)
➤ NUMERIC(p,s) – Similar to DECIMAL, used for precise financial calculations
➤ FLOAT / DOUBLE – Approximate floating-point numbers (4-byte) (not always precise)

By default all the numeric dataypes can have negative as well as positive values. This restrict the range so if we know there is only +ve values which is stored we use UNSIGNED attribute (0-255).
✅Example: Salary can never be in negative or age also.

Command:
CREATE TABLE example1(
    id INT UNSIGNED
);

✅ 2. Character/String Data Types
Used to store text.

➤ CHAR(n) – Fixed-length string range(0-255) (e.g., CHAR(10) stores exactly 10 characters)
➤ VARCHAR(n) – Variable-length string range(0-255) (up to n characters)
➤ TEXT – Large text blocks (no fixed limit like VARCHAR)

✅ 3. Date and Time Data Types
Used to store date/time values.

➤ DATE – Stores a date (YYYY-MM-DD)
➤ TIME – Stores a time (HH:MM:SS)
➤ DATETIME – Stores both date and time
➤ TIMESTAMP – Similar to DATETIME, often used for auto-recording date/time of entry

✅ 4. Boolean Data Type
Used for true/false values.

BOOLEAN / BOOL – Stores TRUE or FALSE (internally stored as 1 or 0)

✅ 5. Binary Data Types
Used to store binary data (e.g., images, files).

➤ BINARY(n) – Fixed-length binary data
➤ VARBINARY(n) – Variable-length binary data
➤ BLOB – Binary Large Object, used to store large binary files like images or documents

📝 Tips for Interviews:
➤ Use VARCHAR over CHAR for variable-length strings to save space.
➤ Prefer DECIMAL/NUMERIC over FLOAT for money-related values to maintain precision.
➤ TIMESTAMP is auto-updated on row modification (useful for tracking updates).
